Each of the following solutions has been proven to be effective and we hope to be helpful to you.

## Domain binding

The precondition for binding a domain is that LNMP can accessed by domain name.

Nonetheless, from the perspective of server security and subsequent maintenance considerations, the **Domain Binding** step cannot be omitted.

LNMP domain name binding steps:

1. Connect your Cloud Server
2. Modify [Nginx vhost configuration file](/stack-components.md#apache), change the **ServerName**'s value to your domain name
   ```text
   <VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.mydomain.com # modify it to your domain name
   DocumentRoot "/data/wwwroot/mysite2"
   ...
   ```
3. Save it and restart [Nginx Service](/admin-services.md#apache)


## Use Rewrite

Three steps to use rewrite for your application:

1. Check the [Nginx vhost configuration file](/stack-components.md#apache) to make sure that the Rewrite Module is enabled
   > Rewrite was enabled by default on LNMP
2. Add the *AllowOverride All* to your VirtualHost in the file of [Nginx vhost configuration file](/stack-components.md#apache)
3. Add the **rewrite rules** in the root directory of your application

## Rest MySQL *root* password

1. Connect to your Cloud Server by SSH
2. Run the below command
   ```
   sudo git clone https://github.com/Websoft9/linux.git; cd linux/Mysql_ResetPasswd_Script;sudo sh reset_mysql_password.sh
   ```

## Modify the php.ini

When you want to modify The PHP File Upload Limit, Max Execution Time, Memory Limit...for example:

1. Use SFTP to modify the */etc/php.ini* 
```
# File upload limit
post_max_size = 16M
upload_max_filesize = 16M

# Max Execution Time
max_execution_time = 90

# Memory Limit
memory_limit â€“ Minimum: 256M
```
2. Save it and restart [Nginx Service](/admin-services.md#apache)
